# a-small-project-about-p-values
This project serves as a small project for my BIOS872 (Mathematical Statistics II) class.<br />
We start out with two samples X1: binomial(n1, p1) and X2: binomial(n2, p2), and we try to do the following things: <br />
1) construct a valid p value for testing H0: p1 = p2 based on the distribution of X1|X1 + X2 = t <br />
2) construct an approximately valid p value based on normal approximation for $\hat{a}$
